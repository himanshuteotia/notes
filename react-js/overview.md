Here’s a **detailed list of React.js topics** you should learn to become proficient in building modern, scalable, and high-performance applications:

---

## 🟢 **1. React Basics**
- **What is React?**  
  Understand React's purpose, its component-based architecture, and the concept of declarative programming.
- **Setting Up Environment**  
  - Using **Create React App (CRA)**  
  - Introduction to **Vite** for faster builds  
  - Understanding the project structure
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**  
  Learn how JSX combines HTML with JavaScript and how the browser interprets it.
- **React Components**  
  - **Functional Components** (modern standard)  
  - **Class Components** (legacy but still used in many projects)  
  - **Props and State** management

---

## 📁 **2. Core React Concepts**
- **Component Lifecycle (Class Components)**  
  - `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`
- **useState & useEffect Hooks** (Functional Components)  
  - Managing state and side effects
- **Handling Events**  
  Attach event handlers like `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.
- **Conditional Rendering**  
  Use `if`, ternary operators, and logical `&&` for rendering components based on conditions.
- **Lists and Keys**  
  Using `.map()` to render lists and understanding the role of keys.

---

## ⚙️ **3. React Hooks (Modern React)**
- **Built-in Hooks**  
  - `useState()` for state management  
  - `useEffect()` for side effects  
  - `useContext()` for global state  
  - `useRef()` for accessing DOM elements  
  - `useReducer()` for complex state logic  
  - `useMemo()` & `useCallback()` for performance optimization
- **Custom Hooks**  
  Build reusable logic using custom hooks.
  
*Example Custom Hook:*
```javascript
function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  return { count, increment };
}
```

---

## 🏗️ **4. State Management**
- **React Context API**  
  Manage global state without prop drilling.
- **Redux Toolkit**  
  - Actions, Reducers, and Store  
  - Using `createSlice()` and `createAsyncThunk()`  
  - Middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga
- **Zustand, Jotai, or Recoil (Alternative State Managers)**  
  Learn about lightweight state management solutions.

---

## 🧭 **5. Routing and Navigation**
- **React Router (v6+)**  
  - Setting up routes  
  - Nested routes and route parameters  
  - Programmatic navigation using `useNavigate()`  
  - Handling 404 pages
- **Dynamic Routing**  
  Render routes dynamically based on user data or API responses.

---

## 🎨 **6. Styling in React**
- **CSS Modules**  
  Write component-scoped CSS.
- **Styled-Components**  
  Style components using JavaScript with tagged template literals.
- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first CSS framework for building modern UI.
- **SASS/SCSS**  
  Extend CSS with variables, nesting, and mixins.

---

## 🌐 **7. API Integration**
- **Fetch API & Axios**  
  Learn how to make HTTP requests to REST APIs.
- **Async/Await and Promises**  
  Handle asynchronous code effectively.
- **React Query / TanStack Query**  
  - Data fetching, caching, and synchronization  
  - Managing server state with auto-updates and background sync

---

## 🧪 **8. Testing in React**
- **Unit Testing with Jest**  
  Test individual components and functions.
- **React Testing Library**  
  Test components based on user interactions.
- **End-to-End Testing**  
  Use Cypress or Playwright for full integration tests.

---

## ⚡ **9. Performance Optimization**
- **React.memo()**  
  Avoid unnecessary re-renders of functional components.
- **useMemo() & useCallback()**  
  Memoize expensive computations and function references.
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**  
  Load components on demand using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.
- **Virtualization with React-Window or React-Virtualized**  
  Efficiently render large lists.

---

## 🛡️ **10. Security Best Practices**
- **Prevent XSS Attacks**  
  Sanitize user input before rendering.
- **Use HTTPS & CORS Properly**  
  Secure API calls and front-end assets.
- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  - Implement JWT-based auth  
  - Secure routes with private routes and role-based access control

---

## 🌟 **11. Advanced React Topics**
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**  
  Functions that return new components.
- **Render Props**  
  Share code between components using render prop patterns.
- **Portals**  
  Render modals, tooltips, and pop-ups outside the main DOM tree.
- **Error Boundaries**  
  Handle runtime errors in components gracefully.
- **Context with useReducer()**  
  Combine the Context API with `useReducer()` for scalable global state management.

---

## 🏛️ **12. Ecosystem & Popular Libraries**
- **React Query** → For server state management  
- **React Hook Form or Formik** → For form handling and validation  
- **Framer Motion** → For animations  
- **React DnD** → For drag-and-drop functionality
