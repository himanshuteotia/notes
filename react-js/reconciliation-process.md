The **reconciliation process** in React is the **algorithm that decides how to update the UI efficiently when data (state or props) changes**.

Instead of re-rendering the whole page (like traditional DOM updates), React:

* Creates a **new Virtual DOM tree** from the updated components.
* Compares it with the **previous Virtual DOM** (stored in the Fiber Tree).
* Updates only the **changed parts** in the real DOM.

### ✅ **Steps in Reconciliation**

1. **State or Props Change**

   * A component triggers re-render when `setState` or new props arrive.

2. **Create New Virtual DOM (Work-In-Progress Fiber Tree)**

   * React runs the component again to produce new JSX → converted into a new Fiber tree.

3. **Diffing (React’s Algorithm)**

   * Compare the new Fiber tree with the previous Fiber tree (using `alternate` links).
   * React uses **heuristics**:

     * If **type is same** (e.g., `<div>` → `<div>`), keep the node, update props.
     * If **type changes** (e.g., `<div>` → `<span>`), destroy old node and create new one.
     * For lists, React uses **keys** to match elements and reorder efficiently.

4. **Generate Effect List**

   * React notes what needs to be done (update, insert, delete) in an **effect list**.

5. **Commit Phase**

   * React applies minimal changes to the real DOM in a **batch**, not one by one.

### ✅ **Why is it Important?**

* Direct DOM manipulation is slow.
* React’s reconciliation makes updates **fast and smooth**, even for large UIs.

**In short:**
The reconciliation process is how React decides **what to change in the real DOM** after comparing the new and old Virtual DOM trees using the Fiber architecture.
