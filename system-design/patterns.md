# 📊 **System Design Patterns: A Complete Guide**

System design patterns are **proven solutions** to **recurring architectural problems** in **scalable**, **reliable**, and **maintainable** systems. Understanding these patterns is critical when designing complex systems.

---

## 🔖 **1. Architectural Patterns**

These define the **overall structure** and **high-level design** of your system.

### ✅ **1.1 Layered (n-tier) Architecture**
- **Description:** Divides system into layers like **Presentation**, **Business Logic**, **Data Access**, and **Database**.
- **Use Cases:** Web apps, enterprise software.
- **Pros:** Separation of concerns, maintainability.
- **Cons:** Can become slow due to multiple layers.

```
Client → Presentation Layer → Business Logic → Data Layer → Database
```

---

### ✅ **1.2 Microservices Architecture**
- **Description:** Breaks down a monolithic system into smaller, independent **services** that communicate via **APIs**.
- **Use Cases:** E-commerce, banking systems, large-scale web apps.
- **Pros:** Scalability, independent deployment, fault isolation.
- **Cons:** Complex management, requires DevOps.

```
[Service A] ←→ [API Gateway] ←→ [Service B] ←→ [Database]
```

---

### ✅ **1.3 Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Description:** Components communicate through **events** (via queues or streams) rather than direct API calls.
- **Use Cases:** Real-time systems, IoT, streaming platforms.
- **Pros:** Loose coupling, real-time processing.
- **Cons:** Debugging is harder; event ordering issues.

```
Producer → Event Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ) → Consumers
```

---

### ✅ **1.4 Client-Server Architecture**
- **Description:** A **server** provides services, and the **client** consumes them.
- **Use Cases:** Web applications, mobile apps.
- **Pros:** Simple, well-understood.
- **Cons:** Single point of failure if the server goes down.

```
Client ↔ Server ↔ Database
```

---

### ✅ **1.5 Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
- **Description:** Similar to microservices but typically uses **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)** for communication.
- **Use Cases:** Large enterprises with legacy systems.
- **Pros:** Loose coupling, reusable services.
- **Cons:** ESB can become a bottleneck.

---

### ✅ **1.6 Serverless Architecture**
- **Description:** Uses **FaaS** (e.g., AWS Lambda) where code runs in stateless compute containers.
- **Use Cases:** Event-driven apps, scheduled tasks.
- **Pros:** No server management, auto-scaling.
- **Cons:** Cold starts, vendor lock-in.

```
Client → API Gateway → Lambda Functions → Database
```

---

## 🟢 **2. Structural Patterns**

These define how **components interact** with each other.

### ✅ **2.1 Proxy Pattern**
- **Description:** A proxy acts as an intermediary for requests to another object.
- **Use Cases:** API gateways, caching proxies.
- **Example:** NGINX as a reverse proxy.

---

### ✅ **2.2 Gateway Pattern (API Gateway)**
- **Description:** Acts as a single entry point to a system of microservices.
- **Use Cases:** Microservices, mobile backends.
- **Pros:** Simplifies client interactions, supports authentication.
- **Cons:** Single point of failure.

---

### ✅ **2.3 Broker Pattern**
- **Description:** Distributes tasks to multiple servers using a **broker**.
- **Use Cases:** Job queues, messaging systems.
- **Example:** RabbitMQ, Kafka.

---

### ✅ **2.4 Facade Pattern**
- **Description:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Use Cases:** API abstraction layers.

---

## 🔵 **3. Data Management Patterns**

These manage how data is stored, accessed, and synchronized.

### ✅ **3.1 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- **Description:** Separates **read** and **write** operations into different models.
- **Use Cases:** High-performance apps, event-sourced systems.
- **Pros:** Optimizes read/write separately.
- **Cons:** Increased complexity.

---

### ✅ **3.2 Event Sourcing**
- **Description:** Stores state as a sequence of events rather than current data.
- **Use Cases:** Financial systems, audit logs.
- **Pros:** Complete history, easy rollback.
- **Cons:** Complex querying.

---

### ✅ **3.3 Database Sharding**
- **Description:** Horizontally splits a database into smaller, faster parts called **shards**.
- **Use Cases:** Large-scale data storage (e.g., social networks).
- **Pros:** Scalability.
- **Cons:** Complex joins across shards.

---

### ✅ **3.4 Cache Aside (Lazy Loading)**
- **Description:** Load data into cache on-demand.
- **Use Cases:** Caching user profiles, product catalogs.
- **Pros:** Reduced DB load.
- **Cons:** Cache misses initially.

```javascript
if (!cache.get(key)) {
  let data = db.query(key);
  cache.set(key, data);
}
```

---

### ✅ **3.5 Write-Through Cache**
- **Description:** Writes go to both the cache and the database.
- **Use Cases:** High-read, low-write scenarios.

---

### ✅ **3.6 Read-Replicas**
- **Description:** Use secondary databases for read operations to reduce load on primary DB.
- **Use Cases:** Reporting systems, analytics.

---

## 🟡 **4. Scalability and Reliability Patterns**

These ensure systems scale efficiently and remain resilient.

### ✅ **4.1 Load Balancer Pattern**
- **Description:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
- **Use Cases:** High-traffic web apps.
- **Example:** NGINX, AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

---

### ✅ **4.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- **Description:** Prevents cascading failures by "breaking" connections when downstream services fail.
- **Use Cases:** Microservices.
- **Example:** Netflix’s Hystrix.

---

### ✅ **4.3 Rate Limiting**
- **Description:** Limits the number of API calls per user or client.
- **Use Cases:** Public APIs.
- **Example:** 429 Too Many Requests response.

---

### ✅ **4.4 Bulkhead Pattern**
- **Description:** Isolates services to prevent failures from spreading.
- **Use Cases:** Microservices.
- **Example:** Separate thread pools.

---

### ✅ **4.5 Retry Pattern**
- **Description:** Automatically retries failed operations.
- **Use Cases:** Network failures, API calls.

---

### ✅ **4.6 Idempotency Pattern**
- **Description:** Ensures that repeating an operation produces the same result.
- **Use Cases:** Payment systems (avoid duplicate charges).

---

## 🟣 **5. Messaging and Queueing Patterns**

These manage asynchronous communication and decouple system components.

### ✅ **5.1 Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub)**
- **Description:** Senders (publishers) send messages to **topics**, and subscribers receive messages.
- **Use Cases:** Real-time notifications, streaming.
- **Example:** Kafka, RabbitMQ.

---

### ✅ **5.2 Message Queue Pattern**
- **Description:** A **queue** holds messages until they are processed by consumers.
- **Use Cases:** Asynchronous processing, task queues.
- **Example:** AWS SQS, RabbitMQ.

---

### ✅ **5.3 Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions)**
- **Description:** Manages distributed transactions through a series of local transactions.
- **Use Cases:** Microservices that need to maintain data consistency.

```
Service A → Service B → Service C
```

If one service fails, **compensating transactions** are triggered.

---

## 🟤 **6. Security Patterns**

### ✅ **6.1 Authentication and Authorization**
- **OAuth 2.0**, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure APIs.

### ✅ **6.2 API Gateway Security**
- Implement **rate limiting**, **IP whitelisting**, and **API keys**.

### ✅ **6.3 Encryption Patterns**
- Use **TLS/SSL** for data in transit and **AES** for data at rest.
