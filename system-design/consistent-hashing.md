### üí° **Consistent Hashing** ‚Äî *A Key Concept in Distributed Systems*

**Consistent Hashing** is a **distributed hashing technique** that minimizes data movement when scaling a distributed system. It's widely used in **distributed caching**, **load balancing**, and **sharding** databases (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB).

---

## ‚ö° **Why Consistent Hashing?**

In traditional hashing methods (like modulo-based hashing), adding or removing servers can cause massive **data reshuffling**.

**Example:**

```javascript
hash(key) % number_of_servers
```

- If the number of servers changes, most keys map to new servers, causing instability.

**‚úÖ Consistent Hashing solves this by:**
1. Reducing the number of keys that need remapping when nodes are added/removed.
2. Ensuring better **fault tolerance** and **scalability**.

---

## üéØ **Core Concepts of Consistent Hashing:**

1. **Hash Ring (or Circle):**  
   Imagine all possible hash values placed on a **circular ring** (0 to 2¬≥¬≤-1).

2. **Node Placement:**  
   Each server (node) is hashed and placed on the ring.

3. **Key Placement:**  
   Data keys are also hashed and placed on the ring. A key is assigned to the first server encountered when moving **clockwise**.

4. **Virtual Nodes (VNodes):**  
   Each physical server is assigned multiple virtual nodes to ensure **even load distribution**.

---

## üîÑ **How It Works:**

### ‚úÖ **1. Adding a Node:**
- Only a **subset** of keys need to be moved to the new node.
- Keys that "fall" between the previous node and the new node are re-mapped.

### ‚úÖ **2. Removing a Node:**
- Only keys belonging to the removed node need to be redistributed.

**üí• This is why consistent hashing is "consistent" ‚Äî minimal data movement.**

---

## üìä **Visual Representation:**

```
[Hash Ring]
  | Node A (0) |
  | Node B (90)|
  | Node C (180)|
  | Node D (270)|

Keys hashed to positions are placed on the circle. Each key maps to the next available node clockwise.
```

---

## üü° **Real-World Use Cases:**

1. **Distributed Caches (e.g., Memcached):**  
   Consistent hashing avoids rehashing all keys when servers are added/removed.

2. **Distributed Databases (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra):**  
   Ensures that data is evenly spread and minimizes rebalancing.

3. **Load Balancers:**  
   Consistent hashing is used to route client requests to the same backend server.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Consistent Hashing Implementation (JavaScript Example):**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

class ConsistentHashing {
  constructor(nodes = [], replicas = 3) {
    this.replicas = replicas; // Virtual nodes
    this.ring = new Map();
    this.sortedKeys = [];

    nodes.forEach(node => this.addNode(node));
  }

  // Hashing function using SHA-256
  hash(str) {
    return parseInt(crypto.createHash('sha256').update(str).digest('hex').substring(0, 8), 16);
  }

  // Add node with replicas
  addNode(node) {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.replicas; i++) {
      const nodeHash = this.hash(node + i);
      this.ring.set(nodeHash, node);
      this.sortedKeys.push(nodeHash);
    }
    this.sortedKeys.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  }

  // Remove node
  removeNode(node) {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.replicas; i++) {
      const nodeHash = this.hash(node + i);
      this.ring.delete(nodeHash);
      this.sortedKeys = this.sortedKeys.filter(key => key !== nodeHash);
    }
  }

  // Get node for a key
  getNode(key) {
    const keyHash = this.hash(key);
    for (let i = 0; i < this.sortedKeys.length; i++) {
      if (keyHash <= this.sortedKeys[i]) {
        return this.ring.get(this.sortedKeys[i]);
      }
    }
    // If not found, wrap around the ring
    return this.ring.get(this.sortedKeys[0]);
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Example Usage
const ch = new ConsistentHashing(['NodeA', 'NodeB', 'NodeC'], 3);

console.log('Key1 =>', ch.getNode('Key1')); // Maps to a node
console.log('Key2 =>', ch.getNode('Key2'));

ch.addNode('NodeD'); // Add new node
console.log('Key1 after adding NodeD =>', ch.getNode('Key1')); // Minimal remapping

ch.removeNode('NodeB'); // Remove node
console.log('Key2 after removing NodeB =>', ch.getNode('Key2'));
```

## üí• **Benefits of Consistent Hashing:**

1. **Scalability:**  
   Easily add/remove nodes with minimal data reshuffling.

2. **Fault Tolerance:**  
   If a node fails, only its keys are reassigned.

3. **Load Balancing:**  
   With virtual nodes, the load is evenly spread across servers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges & Solutions:**

| **Problem**                  | **Solution**                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Uneven Key Distribution**   | Use **Virtual Nodes** (replicas).  |
| **Hotspots on Certain Nodes** | Randomize node placement & use VNodes. |
| **Node Failures**             | Reassign affected keys using the ring. |

## üî• **Real-World Systems Using Consistent Hashing:**

- **Amazon DynamoDB** ‚Äî for partitioning data.
- **Cassandra** ‚Äî distributes data across nodes using consistent hashing.
- **Memcached (via Ketama)** ‚Äî for distributed caching.
- **NGINX Load Balancer** ‚Äî to ensure sticky sessions.

## üéØ **Summary:**

| **Traditional Hashing**               | **Consistent Hashing**               |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Rehashes most keys when nodes change. | Only affects a small subset of keys. |
| Poor scaling.                         | Dynamic scaling (add/remove nodes).  |
| Single point of failure is critical.  | Supports redundancy & fault-tolerance.|

### üßä Ice Cream Shops Around a Circular Road

Imagine there‚Äôs a **circular road** (like a ring). On this road, there are 3 ice cream shops placed like this:

* üè™ Shop A at 100 meters
* üè™ Shop B at 200 meters
* üè™ Shop C at 300 meters

Now, a kid (like your key or user) is standing at **150 meters**. The rule is:

> Go to the **next shop clockwise** on the road.

So the kid at **150m** will go to Shop B (at 200m).
Another kid at **250m** will go to Shop C (at 300m).
And a kid at **310m** goes back around the circle to Shop A (at 100m).

This is **how the hash ring works**.

---

### üîÅ What if a new shop is added?

Say you add:

* üè™ Shop D at 260 meters

Now:

* The kid at 250m now goes to Shop D instead of Shop C.

But all other kids go to the same shops as before. ‚úÖ

---

### üß† Final Understanding

* Servers = Shops
* User or Data = Kid
* Hash ring = Circular road
* Hash value = Position on road
* Rule = Go to next shop clockwise
* Only a few users change when a shop is added or removed.
