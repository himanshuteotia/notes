A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is basically a network of servers distributed across the world that delivers content to users from the server closest to them.

Here‚Äôs why it exists: if TikTok stored all its videos in one data center in the US, a user in India or Dubai would get terrible latency (slow load times, buffering). A CDN fixes this.

---

### How it works

‚û≠ You upload a video ‚Üí it‚Äôs stored in an origin server (main storage).
‚û≠ The CDN copies that video into **edge servers** around the globe.
‚û≠ When a user requests the video, they get it from the nearest edge server instead of the origin.

---

### Benefits

‚û≠ **Low latency**: Data travels a shorter distance, so playback feels instant.
‚û≠ **High availability**: If one server goes down, others serve the content.
‚û≠ **Reduced load** on origin servers, since edges handle most requests.
‚û≠ **Scalability**: CDNs are built to handle millions/billions of requests.

---

### What CDNs usually serve

‚û≠ Static content: images, CSS, JavaScript files, videos.
‚û≠ Streaming media (like TikTok, YouTube, Netflix).
‚û≠ Sometimes even dynamic content with edge computing.

Think of it like this:
Instead of everyone in the world ordering pizza from one restaurant in New York, there are franchise outlets (edge servers) in every major city. You still get the same pizza, but much faster.

**deeper dive into how CDN actually works under the hood** (cache invalidation, edge vs origin, etc.)?

let‚Äôs go deeper. A CDN is more than ‚Äúservers closer to users.‚Äù Under the hood it‚Äôs a whole system of caching, routing, and optimization. Let‚Äôs break it down.

---

### 1. Origin vs Edge

* **Origin server**: where the original content lives (say, AWS S3 bucket with your videos).
* **Edge servers (PoPs = Points of Presence)**: distributed servers across the globe that cache copies of the content.

When a user requests a file, the CDN routes them to the closest edge.

---

### 2. How caching actually works

* First request: If the edge doesn‚Äôt have the file (cache miss), it fetches it from the origin and stores it locally.
* Next requests: Served directly from that edge cache (cache hit).
* Expiration: Each cached object has a TTL (time-to-live). After it expires, the edge revalidates or re-fetches from the origin.

This is controlled by **HTTP cache headers** like `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, and `ETag`.

---

### 3. Cache invalidation (the tricky part)

What if you update a file (say, user changes their profile pic)?

* You can **purge** the file across all edges.
* Or use **versioned URLs** (e.g., `/image-v2.png`) so CDNs treat it as a new resource.
* Some CDNs support **soft purge** ‚Üí mark as stale but still serve until fresh copy arrives.

---

### 4. Routing logic

When a user requests `video.mp4`:

1. DNS resolves your domain ‚Üí points to CDN instead of your origin.
2. CDN decides which edge is ‚Äúbest‚Äù based on:

   * Geographic proximity
   * Network latency (sometimes closer ‚â† faster)
   * Load balancing (avoid overloaded PoPs)
3. User is routed transparently to that edge.

---

### 5. Dynamic acceleration

Modern CDNs don‚Äôt just serve static files:

* **Dynamic content acceleration**: Even API responses can be cached at the edge with short TTL.
* **Edge computing (serverless at the edge)**: Run code (like authentication checks, A/B testing, personalization) directly at the edge to cut latency.

---

### 6. Security role of CDNs

* DDoS protection: Absorb traffic spikes since they sit in front of origin.
* TLS termination: Handle HTTPS at the edge instead of your servers.
* WAF (Web Application Firewall): Block bad requests before they hit your origin.

---

### 7. Real-world example: TikTok video delivery

* User uploads video ‚Üí stored in origin (say, S3).
* CDN (like Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly) pulls that video into edge caches worldwide.
* When a user in Dubai watches it, request goes to nearest PoP in Dubai/Abu Dhabi, not US.
* If cache miss ‚Üí fetch from S3, then cache it locally for others in that region.

---

### 8. Key trade-offs

* **Freshness vs Performance**: Longer TTL = faster but stale content risk. Shorter TTL = fresher but more origin hits.
* **Cost vs Coverage**: More PoPs = better performance but higher CDN cost.
* **Static vs Dynamic**: Static is easy to cache, dynamic needs more careful rules.

üëâ So under the hood, a CDN is basically:
**A globally distributed cache + smart routing + security layer sitting between users and your origin.**

Here‚Äôs how you can explain CDN in an interview in a **crisp but strong way**. Aim for structure: definition ‚Üí working ‚Üí benefits ‚Üí trade-offs.

**Answer style (2‚Äì3 mins):**

*A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a globally distributed set of servers that sit between users and the origin server to deliver content faster and more reliably.*

**How it works:**
When a user requests something like a video or image, the request is routed to the nearest edge server (Point of Presence). If the file is cached there, it‚Äôs served immediately (cache hit). If not, the edge fetches it from the origin, stores it, and then serves future users from cache (cache miss). This reduces latency since data travels a shorter distance.

**Benefits:**

* Low latency and faster load times
* Offloads traffic from the origin server
* Increases availability and scalability
* Adds security features like DDoS protection and TLS termination

**Trade-offs:**
The main challenge is cache freshness vs performance. Long TTLs improve speed but may serve stale content, while short TTLs keep content fresh but increase load on the origin. To handle this, CDNs support cache invalidation and versioned URLs.

**Example:**
For something like TikTok, videos are stored in origin storage but replicated to CDN edges globally. A user in Dubai streams from a local edge rather than hitting the US server, which keeps playback smooth and reduces cost on the origin.
