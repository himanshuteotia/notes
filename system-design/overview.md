### 1. **Basics of System Design**
   - **Introduction to System Design**: Understanding what system design is and why it's important.
   - **System Design Methodologies**: Different approaches like Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, etc.

### 2. **Design Patterns**
   - **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype.
   - **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Flyweight.
   - **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Command, State.

### 3. **Software Architecture**
   - **Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture**
   - **Serverless Architecture**
   - **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

### 4. **Database Design**
   - **Relational Database Design**: Normalization, ER diagrams, SQL.
   - **NoSQL Database Design**: Types of NoSQL databases, when to use them, design considerations.
   - **Database Scaling**: Sharding, Replication, Partitioning.

### 5. **API Design**
   - **RESTful API Design**: Principles, best practices, security considerations.
   - **GraphQL**: Benefits, use cases, differences from REST.
   - **API Gateway**: Managing APIs, rate limiting, API versioning.

### 6. **Scalability and Reliability**
   - **Load Balancing**: Algorithms, tools, and techniques.
   - **Caching Strategies**: Redis, Memcached, caching patterns.
   - **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Techniques and tools.
   - **Failover and Disaster Recovery**: Strategies and implementation.

### 7. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Optimizing Latency and Throughput**
   - **Profiling and Load Testing**: Tools and techniques.
   - **Database Performance Tuning**: Indexing, query optimization.

### 8. **Security Practices**
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: OAuth, JWT, SAML.
