Rollback and dependency management can get tricky in microservices because services are independent but connected. Let’s break this down clearly.

### The Problem with Dependencies and Rollbacks:

When microservices interact, transactions often span multiple services. If something goes wrong, it can be tough to roll everything back cleanly because each service manages its own database independently.

Here’s how microservices typically handle this:

---

## ➀ Avoid Distributed Transactions (the Problem of Two-Phase Commits)

Traditionally, you might have used distributed transactions (two-phase commits). But in microservices, that can become slow, complicated, and fragile. Instead, we prefer simpler, more robust patterns.

---

## ➁ Use Saga Pattern (Most Commonly Used Solution)

The **Saga Pattern** is a reliable way to handle multi-service transactions:

➭ **Step-by-step execution:**

* Transactions are divided into multiple steps.
* Each service executes its local transaction independently.

➭ **Compensation transactions:**

* If a failure occurs mid-way, previously successful services execute “compensation” transactions (undo actions) to roll back.
* Compensation isn’t a database rollback; it’s a logical undo (e.g., refund a payment, restock inventory).

**Example**:

Consider an e-commerce order:

* **Order Service:** creates order.
* **Inventory Service:** reserves inventory.
* **Payment Service:** processes payment.

If **Payment Service** fails:

* Inventory Service executes a compensation action (releases reserved stock).
* Order Service cancels or marks the order as failed.

---

## ➂ Eventual Consistency (Key Concept)

Microservices generally embrace eventual consistency instead of strong immediate consistency:

➭ Immediate consistency across multiple databases is tough.

➭ Microservices often accept a brief state where data isn't perfectly synced—but eventually becomes consistent after compensating actions.

---

## ➃ Event-Driven Communication (to ease dependency handling)

Using event-driven patterns (Kafka, RabbitMQ) significantly reduces tight coupling:

➭ Services send events after completing tasks.

➭ Dependent services react asynchronously.

➭ Failures can trigger compensation events, making rollback easier and less risky.

**Example**:

* Order Service publishes "Order Created" event.
* Inventory Service listens and reserves inventory.
* If payment fails, Payment Service publishes "Payment Failed" event.
* Inventory listens and reverts reservation automatically.

---

## ➄ Idempotency and Retry Logic

Microservices should be designed idempotently:

➭ Repeated calls have the same effect (useful if a retry happens after a temporary failure).

➭ Retries and automatic recovery can minimize the need for manual rollbacks.

---

## ➅ Good Observability and Monitoring (Essential)

If things go wrong, you need to know quickly:

➭ Use logging, tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Zipkin, Jaeger), and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).

➭ Automated alerts help catch and address problems early.

---

## Real-World Scenario: Rollback with Saga Pattern

Let’s simplify with an example:

**Transaction:** Order → Inventory → Payment → Shipping

* **Step 1:** Order Service creates an order.
* **Step 2:** Inventory Service reserves stock.
* **Step 3:** Payment Service charges payment (FAILS HERE!)

  * **Compensation:** Inventory Service releases reserved stock.
  * **Compensation:** Order Service cancels the order.
* **Step 4:** Shipping Service never triggered, no need for rollback.

Here’s the beauty—this approach is clear, robust, and predictable.

---

## Practical Tips:

➭ Clearly define compensating actions upfront for each critical transaction.

➭ Limit interdependencies to minimize complex rollbacks.

➭ Embrace eventual consistency. Perfect real-time rollback across multiple services is usually unrealistic.

➭ Use event-driven architecture to simplify rollbacks.

---

**Bottom line**: You manage dependencies and rollbacks with patterns like Saga, compensating transactions, event-driven architecture, and accepting eventual consistency. This approach isn’t perfect, but it’s pragmatic and battle-tested.
