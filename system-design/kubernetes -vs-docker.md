Kubernetes and Docker are both key tools in the containerization ecosystem, but they serve different purposes:

### **1. What is Docker?**
Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments.

### **2. What is Kubernetes?**
Kubernetes (K8s) is an **orchestration system** for managing, scaling, and deploying containerized applications. It helps manage clusters of containers efficiently.

## **Key Differences Between Kubernetes and Docker**

| Feature | **Docker** | **Kubernetes** |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Used for creating, running, and managing individual containers | Orchestrates and manages multiple containers across multiple nodes |
| **Scaling** | Manually scale containers or use Docker Swarm | Automatically scales containers based on demand |
| **Networking** | Uses simple, built-in networking (Docker Bridge) | Provides advanced networking across clusters |
| **Load Balancing** | Basic load balancing | Built-in load balancing and service discovery |
| **Storage** | Supports data persistence with volumes | Supports dynamic storage provisioning with Persistent Volumes |
| **Deployment** | Containers need to be managed manually or via Docker Compose | Automated deployment and rollback features with declarative configuration |
| **Self-healing** | Containers do not restart automatically on failure | Automatically restarts failed containers and ensures desired state |
| **Multi-container Management** | Uses `docker-compose` to manage multi-container applications | Uses Pods, Deployments, and ReplicaSets to manage containers |

## **Do They Compete?**
No! Docker and Kubernetes **complement each other**:

1. **Docker** is used to build and run containers.
2. **Kubernetes** is used to orchestrate and manage multiple containers.

However, Kubernetes is not limited to Docker. It can also work with other container runtimes like **containerd** or **CRI-O**.

## **When to Use What?**
- **Use Docker** when you want to run and manage a few containers on your local machine.
- **Use Kubernetes** when you need to manage multiple containers at scale in production environments.
