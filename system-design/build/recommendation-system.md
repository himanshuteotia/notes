- Uses **Kafka** or **AWS Kinesis** to stream events.

### ✅ **1.2 Stream Processing**
- Processes user events in real-time using **Apache Spark Streaming**, **Flink**, or **AWS Kinesis Analytics**.
- Computes real-time features like:
  - Most viewed videos.
  - Trending content.
  - User watch patterns.

### ✅ **1.3 Recommendation Engine**
- Uses a combination of:
  - **Collaborative Filtering** (e.g., ALS algorithm).
  - **Content-Based Filtering** (e.g., TF-IDF or Word2Vec embeddings).
  - **Hybrid Methods** (combining both).

### ✅ **1.4 Machine Learning Models**
- Trained using historical data in batch jobs.
- Fine-tuned using **real-time feedback** from users.
- Hosted on **AWS SageMaker**, **TensorFlow Serving**, or **MLflow**.

### ✅ **1.5 Feature Store**
- Stores real-time computed features for each user and item.
- **Redis**, **Cassandra**, or **DynamoDB** for low-latency reads/writes.

# 📡 **2. Data Flow in Real-Time Recommendation System:**

### ✅ **2.1 Real-Time Processing Pipeline:**

1. **User Action** → View/Like/Comment is triggered.
2. **Event Stream** → Event is sent to **Kafka** or **Kinesis**.
3. **Stream Processor** → **Spark Streaming** processes the event and updates user/item profiles.
4. **Feature Store Update** → Updates are stored in **Redis** or **Cassandra**.
5. **Recommendation Engine** → Generates updated recommendations and serves them through APIs.
6. **Client Update** → UI updates recommendations in real-time.

---

### ✅ **2.2 Batch Processing Pipeline:**

1. **Daily Data Dump** from transactional DB into a **Data Lake** (S3) or **Data Warehouse** (Redshift/BigQuery).
2. **ETL Jobs** process data using **Apache Spark** or **AWS Glue**.
3. **Model Training** using historical data for collaborative filtering.
4. **Model Deployment** to the Recommendation Engine.

# 🔥 **5. Detailed Architecture Walkthrough:**

## 📥 **5.1 Data Ingestion (Kafka/Kinesis)**
- Every user action (like a video play or like) is sent to **Kafka**.
- Use Kafka topics like:
  - `user-interactions`
  - `video-metadata`
  - `user-profile-updates`

---

## 📊 **5.2 Stream Processing (Spark Streaming/Flink)**
- Consume Kafka streams.
- Update real-time metrics like:
  - Top 10 trending videos.
  - User’s watch patterns.
- Use **windowed operations** to analyze data over time.

---

## 🤖 **5.3 Machine Learning (Recommendation Engine)**
- **Collaborative Filtering (ALS):**
  - Matrix factorization of user-item ratings.
  - Handles implicit feedback (e.g., views, likes).
  
- **Content-Based Filtering:**
  - Use metadata (tags, title, genre) to recommend similar items.
  
- **Hybrid System:**
  - Merge results from collaborative and content-based filtering.
  - Use **ML ranking models** (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) to rank results.

---

## 🚀 **5.4 Real-Time Recommendations API**
- Built using **FastAPI** or **GraphQL**.
- Fetches real-time user features from Redis.
- Calls the recommendation engine and returns personalized content.
