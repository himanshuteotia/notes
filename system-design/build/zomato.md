# üèÜ **1. Core Components Explained:**

## ‚úÖ **1.1 API Gateway**
- Handles all incoming API requests from web/mobile.
- Performs rate-limiting, authentication, and load balancing.
- Services communicate internally via **gRPC** or **REST APIs**.

---

## ‚úÖ **1.2 User Service**
- Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
- Supports **JWT tokens** for authentication.
- Stores data in **MySQL/PostgreSQL**.

---

## ‚úÖ **1.3 Restaurant Service**
- Manages restaurant profiles, menus, and availability.
- **MongoDB** for flexible menu structures (nested categories, items).
- Supports geo-location-based searches using **ElasticSearch**.

---

## ‚úÖ **1.4 Order Service**
- Core service for managing order placement, status updates, and order history.
- Uses **PostgreSQL** (ACID-compliant) for order consistency.
- Coordinates with:
  - **Payment Service** for transactions.
  - **Delivery Service** for assigning delivery agents.

---

## ‚úÖ **1.5 Delivery Service**
- Tracks delivery agents in real-time using **GPS**.
- Uses **Redis** for quick geo-queries and location tracking.
- Uses a **matching algorithm** to assign the nearest delivery agent.

---

## ‚úÖ **1.6 Payment Service**
- Integrates with **Stripe, Razorpay**, or other gateways.
- Handles pre-authorization and payment capture post-delivery.
- Ensures PCI-DSS compliance.

---

## ‚úÖ **1.7 Notification Service**
- Manages push notifications, emails, and SMS updates.
- Uses services like **AWS SNS** or **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**.

---

# üì° **2. Data Flow (Order Placement to Delivery):**

1. **Customer selects a restaurant and places an order.**
2. **API Gateway** routes the request to the **Order Service**.
3. **Payment Service** pre-authorizes the payment.
4. **Order Service** writes the order into the **Order DB** and triggers events via **Kafka**.
5. **Delivery Service** picks up the event and assigns a delivery agent based on proximity.
6. **Restaurant Service** notifies the restaurant to start preparing the food.
7. Once the food is picked up, **real-time GPS tracking** starts.
8. On delivery completion, the payment is captured, and the customer is notified.
