Nice — here’s a practical, no-fluff system design for a TikTok-like platform that uses everything we discussed: uploads, VOD transcoding, ABR, low-latency live, delivery, recommendation, and scale. I’ll give architecture, components, data stores, traffic patterns, key knobs (codecs, GOP, bitrates), deployment notes, and example commands you can paste into your pipeline.

---

# Goal

Build a global short-video platform: fast uploads, efficient storage, instant-ish availability, adaptive playback on mobile, discovery/recommendation feed, live streaming support, and the ability to scale to millions of creators and viewers.

---

# High-level architecture (single diagram in words)

Client (mobile/web) → API Gateway / Edge → Upload Ingest → Job Queue (Kafka) → Transcoder pool (K8s; GPU workers) → Packaging (CMAF/fMP4) + Thumbnails + Captions + Watermarking → Object Store (S3) + CDN + Metadata DB → Recommendation Service + Edge Cache (Redis / ElastiCache) → Client Player (HLS/DASH/CMAF or WebRTC for live)
Supporting systems: User DB, Analytics (events -> Kafka -> Clickhouse/BigQuery), Search (Elasticsearch), Moderation AI, Auth + Rate limits, Monitoring.

---

# Components & responsibilities

### 1) Client & Edge

* Mobile app uploads video via **resumable multipart upload** to an authenticated edge endpoint (pre-signed URL pattern).
* Edge validates file headers, quick virus/malware checks, basic heuristics (duration, size), and forwards an upload-complete event to Kafka.
* Use CDN edge nodes for playback (CloudFront/Cloudflare/Akamai) and for storing short-lived upload staging.

### 2) Upload / Ingest

* Accepts uploads via HTTP(s). Support chunked uploads (tus protocol / AWS multipart) so flaky mobile networks can resume.
* On completion push `UploadCompleted` event to Kafka topic `ingest.events`.

### 3) Job Queue & Orchestration

* Use **Kafka** (or Pulsar) for durable ingestion events.
* A controller service schedules jobs: transcode, generate thumbnails, extract audio, speech-to-text, moderation checks, metadata extraction.
* Use a CRD-style orchestrator (K8s + custom controller or Argo Workflows) for multi-step pipelines.

### 4) Transcoding & Packaging

* Transcoder pool in Kubernetes:

  * GPU-backed nodes (NVidia) for live or heavy VOD transcodes; CPU nodes for low-throughput tasks.
  * Autoscale workers by queue lag.
* Produce ABR renditions and package into **CMAF / fMP4** so you can serve both HLS and DASH with the same segments.
* Recommended encoding defaults for short-form content:

  * Codec: **H.264 (baseline)** for wide compatibility; optionally encode AV1 for high-value content or web targets.
  * Keyframe/GOP: **1–2s** (helps fast start & bitrate switches).
  * Segment/chunk size: **1s** for low-latency viewing; 2s is ok for slightly less overhead.
  * Audio: AAC-LC 64–128 kbps or Opus for WebRTC/live.

Example FFmpeg snippet for CMAF fMP4 renditions (use in transcoder container):

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -y \
  -map 0:v -map 0:a \
  -c:v libx264 -preset fast -g 48 -keyint_min 48 -sc_threshold 0 \
  -b:v:0 2500k -s:v:0 1280x720 \
  -b:v:1 1200k -s:v:1 854x480 \
  -b:v:2 700k  -s:v:2 640x360 \
  -c:a aac -b:a 64k \
  -f dash -use_timeline 1 -use_template 1 -seg_duration 1 \
  out.mpd
```

(Adjust `-g` to match segment duration; for 1s segments at 24–30fps, g≈24–30; for smaller latency use hardware encoders.)

### 5) Storage & CDN

* Long-term storage: **S3 / GCS** with lifecycle rules (hot for recent, cold for older).
* Use CDN for global delivery. Configure origin pulls from S3; use signed URLs/tokens for private content.
* For very hot, newly uploaded content (first minutes/hours), use edge cache warming + short TTLs.

### 6) Metadata & Indexing

* Metadata DB (user, video metadata, owner, captions, tags, length, popularity counters): **Cassandra** or **DynamoDB** for high write throughput and global distribution.
* Search & discovery index: **Elasticsearch / Opensearch** for text search (captions, hashtags), with near-real-time updates.

### 7) Recommendation & Feed

* Event stream (watch, like, skip, share) → Kafka → real-time features (Redis / materialized views) + offline batch features (Spark/Beam).
* Architecture:

  * **Online store** (Redis / RocksDB) for fast per-user candidate scoring.
  * **Candidate generator**: heuristics + collaborative filtering + content-based models.
  * **Ranker**: lightweight deep model or gradient boosted tree running in inference service (gRPC) that scores candidates; cache top-k per user in Redis for fast feed retrieval.
* Use A/B testing, shadow traffic, and rolling model updates.

### 8) Moderation & Safety

* Automatic moderation pipeline: video -> frame sampling -> ML models (NSFW, copyrighted audio) -> manual review queue for flagged content.
* Watermarking or unique fingerprinting for takedowns. Use audio fingerprinting (e.g., AcoustID-like) for copyright.
* Rate-limit uploads and content amplification to avoid abuse.

### 9) Live streaming (optional)

* For live features use:

  * Ingest via **RTMP / SRT** into ingest cluster.
  * For ultra-low latency interactive features, use **WebRTC + SFU (LiveKit/mediasoup)**. For scaled broadcasting with slightly higher latency, use LL-HLS (chunked CMAF).
* Transcoder paths similar but tuned for lower latency (hardware encoders, minimal B-frames, short GOP).

### 10) Caching & Edge logic

* Use **ElastiCache (Redis)** for: session stores, rate limits, feed cursor, per-user top-k cache, and leaderboards.
* Edge logic for playback selection: choose manifest (HLS or DASH) based on UA; return best cached manifest and failover to origin if missing.

# Data model (simplified)

VideoMetadata {
videoId,
ownerId,
uploadTimestamp,
duration,
renditions: \[{resolution, bitrate, url}],
thumbnails: \[url],
captions: text,
tags: \[],
privacy: enum,
visibilityScore,
moderationStatus
}

UserProfile {
userId, followList, interests, deviceInfo, watchHistoryCursor, privacySettings
}

Event (streamed to Kafka): {userId, videoId, eventType (play/pause/complete/like), ts, deviceMetrics}

---

# ABR ladder suggestion for short videos

Use H.264 ABR ladder tuned for mobile (short videos often vertical / lower resolution):

* 360×640 @ 700 kbps (mobile low)
* 540×960 @ 1200 kbps (mobile medium)
* 720×1280 @ 2500 kbps (mobile high)
* 1080×1920 @ 4500–6000 kbps (high-end devices)

Encode primary copy at 720p or 1080p if source allows and derive others.

---

# QoE & monitoring

Track these metrics:

* Startup time (ms), first-frame time.
* Rebuffer events frequency and duration.
* Bitrate switches per session.
* Play completion rate, watch time per user.
* Encoder latency, queue lag, origin errors.
  Push to Prometheus + Grafana; collect client RUM metrics.

---

# Scalability & deployment patterns

* Microservices on Kubernetes. Use node pools:

  * GPU pool for heavy transcodes & live.
  * CPU pool for packaging & light work.
* Autoscale workers with HPA based on queue lag (Kafka consumer lag).
* Shard metadata by userId for even load. Keep consistency via camunda/etcd for leader election where needed.
* Use multi-region read replicas for regional low-latency reads.

---

# Cost & practical trade-offs

* GPU encoding lowers per-channel CPU but costs more per hour; use it for live or high-throughput jobs. For bulk VOD, consider CPU + batch processing during off-peak if latency allows.
* Encode once, store multiple renditions — but storing many renditions costs more; consider on-demand re-encoding for low-traffic items.
* AV1 reduces bandwidth but increases encode costs and has limited playback support.

---

# Security & anti-abuse

* Tokenized uploads & signed CDN URLs. Short TTL for tokens.
* Rate-limits per IP & user.
* Use fingerprinting for copyright enforcement.
* ACLs for private videos. DRM only if distribution needs it.

---

# Example API endpoints (minimal)

* `POST /v1/uploads/start` → returns upload id + presigned URL(s)
* `PUT /v1/uploads/{id}/complete` → triggers ingest event
* `GET /v1/videos/{id}/manifest.m3u8` → serve manifest via CDN (signed)
* `GET /v1/feed?cursor=...` → returns cached top-k candidates and pretrained ranking scores
* `POST /v1/events` → append watch/like events (goes into Kafka)

---

# Example FFmpeg snippets (practical)

1. Fast hardware-accelerated live encode (NVENC):

```bash
ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -i rtmp://ingest/stream \
  -c:v h264_nvenc -preset llhp -rc vbr_hq -cq 19 -b:v 3000k -g 48 \
  -c:a aac -b:a 64k \
  -f hls -hls_time 1 -hls_segment_type fmp4 -hls_flags independent_segments \
  /var/www/hls/stream.m3u8
```

2. VOD multi-rendition CMAF packaging (CPU):

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
  -map 0 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 -g 48 -keyint_min 48 \
  -b:v:0 3000k -s:v:0 1280x720 \
  -b:v:1 1200k -s:v:1 854x480 \
  -b:v:2 600k  -s:v:2 640x360 \
  -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
  -f dash -seg_duration 2 out.mpd
```

# Common pitfalls & tips

* Don’t keep huge GOPs for low-latency or quick scrubbing UX. Keep \~1–2s for TikTok-like short content.
* Align keyframes across renditions for smooth ABR switches.
* Warm CDN caches for trending content — popularity spikes are sudden.
* Keep moderation fast: use ML to triage and human reviewers for edge cases.
* Store fundamental metadata (popularity counters) in a fast store (Redis + async batch to Cassandra).

---

# Rollout plan (MVP)

1. Build upload + resumable ingest + simple transcoding to 2 renditions. Store in S3, serve via CDN.
2. Implement feed API: simple candidate generator (freshness + follow graph).
3. Add Kafka event pipeline and basic recommendation ranking.
4. Add moderation ML and thumbnails + captioning.
5. Introduce ABR full pipeline, more renditions, and GPU workers for scale.
6. Add live streaming with RTMP ingest and WebRTC for low-latency interactions.

---

here’s a concrete, step-by-step component sequence for **upload → transcode → publish**, with exact services, endpoints, event topics, sample payloads, and operational notes. Read it top-to-bottom and you can implement each piece directly.

I’ll assume a cloud setup with an API Gateway, object storage (S3), Kafka (or Pub/Sub), Kubernetes for workers, and a CDN. Service names are literal so you can paste into your infra.

---

# Quick list of components (names you’ll see below)

* Client (mobile/web)
* API Gateway (edge) — `edge.example.com`
* Upload Service — `upload-service` (auth + presigned URLs)
* Ingest Validator — `ingest-validate` (light checks)
* Event Bus — `kafka` (topics listed below)
* Transcode Orchestrator — `transcode-orch` (controller)
* Transcoder Worker (K8s Job/Pod) — `transcoder-worker` (FFmpeg/GPU)
* Packager — `packager-service` (CMAF/HLS/DASH)
* Storage Service / Object Store — `s3://videos-bucket`
* Metadata Service — `metadata-service` (Cassandra/Dynamo)
* CDN (edge) — e.g., CloudFront / Cloudflare
* Notification/Webhook Service — `notify-service` (optional)

---

# Sequence diagram (linear steps)

1. Client requests upload slot
2. Upload Service returns presigned URL(s) + uploadId
3. Client uploads parts (multipart or tus) directly to S3 via presigned URLs
4. Client calls `PUT /v1/uploads/{uploadId}/complete` on Upload Service
5. Upload Service verifies integrity & publishes `ingest.upload.complete` to Kafka
6. Ingest Validator consumes `ingest.upload.complete`, runs quick checks, and forwards `transcode.job.request` to Kafka (or calls `transcode-orch`)
7. Transcode Orchestrator creates a job record, decides node type (GPU/CPU), and schedules a Kubernetes Job (or places message on `transcode.job` topic)
8. Transcoder Worker picks up job, downloads source from S3, transcodes ABR renditions, uploads renditions to `s3://videos-bucket/{videoId}/renditions/`, and emits `transcode.job.complete` with renditions list
9. Packager consumes `transcode.job.complete`, packages CMAF/fMP4 segments, writes manifests (`master.m3u8`, `.mpd`) and uploads to S3, then emits `packaging.complete`
10. Metadata Service updates video metadata (renditions, manifests, thumbnails, duration) after `packaging.complete` and sets `visibility = pending` → runs moderation if needed
11. After moderation pass, `publish.video.ready` event is emitted; CDN pre-warm + CDN invalidation / signed URL generation done; Metadata `visibility = public`
12. Client (or feed service) can now fetch manifest URL from `GET /v1/videos/{id}/manifest` and play via CDN.

# Exact endpoints (external + internal)

### External (client → API Gateway)

1. `POST https://edge.example.com/v1/uploads/start`

   * Request:

     ```json
     { "fileName": "clip.mp4", "contentType": "video/mp4", "size": 42_000_000, "userId": "u123", "metadata": {"title":"..."} }

   * Request:

     ```json
     { "uploadId": "upl_abc123", "checksum": "sha256:...", "userId":"u123" }
     ```
   * Response: `202 Accepted` + `{ "status":"queued", "uploadId":"upl_abc123" }`

3. `GET https://edge.example.com/v1/videos/{videoId}` (public metadata)

   * Response includes manifest URL (CDN):

     ```json
     { "videoId":"v1", "status":"public", "manifests": { "hls":"https://cdn/.../master.m3u8", "dash":"https://cdn/.../manifest.mpd" } }
     ```

### Internal service APIs (example)

* `POST http://transcode-orch.svc.cluster.local/v1/jobs`

  * Body: `{ "videoId": "...", "sourceUrl": "s3://videos-bucket/staging/upl_abc123.mp4", "userId": "...", "priority": "normal" }`

* `POST http://packager.svc.cluster.local/v1/package`

  * Body: `{ "videoId":"...", "renditions":[{...}], "outputPrefix":"s3://videos-bucket/published/v1/" }`

---

# Kafka topics (events)

* `ingest.upload.complete` — payload when upload completes
* `transcode.job.request` — orchestrator request to transcode
* `transcode.job.start` — worker picked job
* `transcode.job.complete` — worker finished (with renditions metadata)
* `packaging.complete` — packaging done (manifests URLs)
* `publish.video.ready` — final event after moderation & CDN warm

Example `ingest.upload.complete` message:

```json
{
  "uploadId":"upl_abc123",
  "videoId":"v1_tmp_abc",
  "userId":"u123",
  "sourceUrl":"s3://videos-bucket/staging/upl_abc123.mp4",
  "checksum":"sha256:...",
  "ts":"2025-09-20T19:01:23Z"
}
```

Example `transcode.job.complete`:

```json
{
  "jobId":"job_xxx",
  "videoId":"v1_tmp_abc",
  "renditions":[
    {"resolution":"720x1280","bitrate":2500000,"url":"s3://videos-bucket/published/v1/720p.mp4"},

# Transcode job: practical K8s job sketch (conceptual)

Run a job that mounts credentials, downloads source, runs FFmpeg, uploads results.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: transcode-job-{{jobId}}
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: transcoder
        image: myregistry/ffmpeg-transcoder:latest
        command: ["/bin/sh","-c"]
        args:
          - |
            set -e
            aws s3 cp s3://videos-bucket/staging/upl_abc123.mp4 /tmp/input.mp4
            /usr/local/bin/transcode.sh /tmp/input.mp4 /tmp/output --video-id v1 --job-id {{jobId}}
            aws s3 cp --recursive /tmp/output s3://videos-bucket/published/v1/
            curl -X POST http://transcode-orch.svc.cluster.local/v1/callback -d '{"jobId":"{{jobId}}","status":"complete"}'
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 3
```

`transcode.sh` runs FFmpeg with your ABR ladder and outputs CMAF segments + manifests.

---

# Packaging step (packager responsibilities)

* Convert renditions into CMAF/fMP4 segments if not already.
* Generate `master.m3u8` (HLS) and `manifest.mpd` (DASH) that reference same fMP4 segments.
* Upload manifests + segments to `s3://videos-bucket/published/{videoId}/`.
* Emit `packaging.complete` with CDN-ready URLs.

---

# Moderation & publish gating

* After `packaging.complete`, push to moderation pipeline:

  * `moderation-service` samples frames + audio, runs models, and either approves or flags.
* If flagged: `metadata.status = blocked` + send to human review queue.
* If approved: emit `publish.video.ready`.

---

# CDN warm & publish

* On `publish.video.ready`:

  * Trigger CDN pre-warm for `master.m3u8` and first few segments (edge prefetch).
  * Generate signed URL or set `visibility=public`.
  * Update Metadata `status=public`.
  * Notify user via `notify-service` (webhook/push).

---

# Idempotency, retries, and guarantees

* Make uploads idempotent using `uploadId` and `checksum`. If `PUT /complete` called twice, ignore duplicate if same checksum.
* Use consumer groups in Kafka and commit offsets only after successful processing. Use dead-letter topic `dlq.*` for poison messages.
* Kubernetes Jobs have `backoffLimit` and you should instrument job success/failure metrics.
* Store job status in Metadata DB and reconcile periodically (orphaned jobs).

---

# Operational notes & tuning

* Small short-video: use 1s segments and GOP aligned with segment size (`-g` ≈ fps \* 1).
* For trending videos: consider pre-encoding an extra high-bitrate rendition and pre-warming CDN.
* For cost: encode common renditions on-demand for older content (lazy transcoding).
* Secure uploads with short-lived presigned URLs + per-user quotas + token auth.
* Expose a health-check endpoint for each service and use Prometheus metrics:

  * `transcode.job.latency`, `queue.lag`, `s3.upload.errors`, `packager.errors`, `moderation.queue.length`.

---

# Sample end-to-end payload flow (compact)

1. Client `POST /v1/uploads/start` → gets `uploadId` + presigned URLs.
2. Upload to S3 directly.
3. Client `PUT /v1/uploads/{uploadId}/complete` → Upload Service emits `ingest.upload.complete`.
4. `transcode-orch` consumes and creates job → schedules K8s Job.
5. `transcoder-worker` finishes → uploads renditions → emits `transcode.job.complete`.
6. `packager-service` packages → uploads manifests → emits `packaging.complete`.
7. `metadata-service` updates → moderation runs → emits `publish.video.ready`.
8. CDN pre-warm and `metadata.status = public`. Video playable via CDN manifest.

---

If you want, I can now:

* Generate the exact FFmpeg `transcode.sh` used by `transcoder-worker` for vertical short-form video (ABR + CMAF + thumbnails + watermark), or
* Produce a fully filled Kubernetes Job YAML + Helm values for the transcoder pool (with GPU node selector and secrets mounted), or
* Write the JSON schema + Avro schema for the Kafka messages above.

Which one should I output next?
