K8s (short for Kubernetes) is an **open-source container orchestration system** designed to manage, scale, and deploy containerized applications automatically. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### **Why Use Kubernetes?**
Kubernetes helps in:
- **Automating Deployment** â€“ You define how your application should run, and Kubernetes ensures it follows those rules.
- **Scaling Applications** â€“ It can scale up/down based on traffic demand.
- **Load Balancing** â€“ It distributes traffic across multiple instances to ensure high availability.
- **Self-Healing** â€“ If a container crashes, Kubernetes restarts it automatically.
- **Service Discovery** â€“ It provides internal networking between services.
- **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks** â€“ It updates applications with zero downtime.

### **Key Components of Kubernetes**
1. **Cluster** â€“ A set of machines (nodes) running Kubernetes.
2. **Node** â€“ A single machine in the cluster (can be a VM or physical server).
3. **Pod** â€“ The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
4. **Service** â€“ A stable way to expose a set of pods to the network.
5. **Deployment** â€“ Manages updates and scaling of applications.
6. **Ingress** â€“ Manages external access to services inside the cluster.

### **Example Use Case**
Imagine you have a Node.js backend and a React frontend running in separate Docker containers. Instead of manually managing these containers, you can use Kubernetes to:
- Deploy them automatically
- Ensure they restart if they fail
- Distribute traffic efficiently
- Scale up/down based on user load

Sure! Letâ€™s go deeper into the **Key Components of Kubernetes** with examples and real-world use cases.

## **1. Cluster** â€“ The Entire Kubernetes System
A **Kubernetes cluster** is a collection of machines (physical or virtual) that work together to run containerized applications. 

### **Structure of a Cluster**
A Kubernetes cluster has:
- **Control Plane (Master Node)** â€“ Manages the cluster and makes decisions.
- **Worker Nodes** â€“ Where your application runs.

> ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A company runs a Node.js backend, a React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database. These services are deployed as containers across multiple worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster ensures all services are running properly.

---

## **2. Node** â€“ A Worker Machine in the Cluster
A **Node** is a single machine inside the Kubernetes cluster, responsible for running application containers.

### **Two Types of Nodes**
1. **Master Node (Control Plane)** â€“ Manages the cluster, schedules workloads, and ensures health checks.
2. **Worker Node** â€“ Executes application workloads inside containers.

### **Components of a Worker Node**
- **Kubelet** â€“ The agent that communicates with the master node.
- **Container Runtime** â€“ Runs the actual containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
- **Kube Proxy** â€“ Manages networking inside the cluster.

> ðŸ“Œ **Example:** You have 3 worker nodes in your cluster. If one crashes, Kubernetes will shift the workload to the remaining two nodes.

---

## **3. Pod** â€“ The Smallest Deployable Unit
A **Pod** is a group of one or more containers that share:
- **Storage (Volumes)**
- **Networking**
- **Configurations (Environment Variables, Secrets, etc.)**

### **Why Use Pods?**
- They allow multiple tightly coupled containers to work together (e.g., an app and a logging sidecar).
- Kubernetes doesnâ€™t manage individual containersâ€”it manages pods.

### **Example of a Pod (YAML Configuration)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-nodejs-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nodejs-app
      image: node:18
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

> ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A Node.js app runs inside a pod. If it crashes, Kubernetes can restart the pod automatically.

---

## **4. Service** â€“ Exposes Pods to Other Services or the Internet
A **Service** provides a stable IP and DNS name to communicate with pods, even if pods are restarted or moved to different nodes.

### **Types of Services**
1. **ClusterIP** (default) â€“ Exposes service internally (within the cluster).
2. **NodePort** â€“ Exposes service externally on a fixed port.
3. **LoadBalancer** â€“ Uses a cloud provider's load balancer to expose the service.
4. **ExternalName** â€“ Maps the service to an external DNS.

### **Example of a Service (YAML Configuration)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-nodejs-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  type: NodePort
```

> ðŸ“Œ **Example:** Your Node.js backend is running in multiple pods. A service ensures that frontend requests reach the correct backend pod.

---

## **5. Deployment** â€“ Manages Scaling and Updates
A **Deployment** is used to:
- **Create** multiple replicas of a pod.
- **Update** applications without downtime (Rolling Updates).
- **Rollback** to a previous version if something goes wrong.

### **Example of a Deployment (YAML Configuration)**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nodejs-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Number of pods
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-nodejs-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-nodejs-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nodejs-container
          image: node:18
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
```

> ðŸ“Œ **Example:** You release a new version of your Node.js app. Kubernetes performs a rolling update, replacing old pods one by one without downtime.

---

## **6. Ingress** â€“ Manages External Access
An **Ingress** is an API object that allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic into the cluster. It provides:
- **Routing** â€“ Directs requests to different services.
- **TLS/SSL** â€“ Supports HTTPS traffic.
- **Path-based and Host-based Routing** â€“ Routes traffic based on URL paths.

### **Example of an Ingress (YAML Configuration)**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

> ðŸ“Œ **Example:** You have multiple services (frontend, backend, admin panel) running in your cluster. An Ingress routes traffic:
- `myapp.example.com` â†’ Frontend service
- `myapp.example.com/api` â†’ Backend service
- `myapp.example.com/admin` â†’ Admin panel

**hands-on guide** to deploying a simple Node.js app on Kubernetes ðŸš€

Let's go step by step and **deploy a simple Node.js application on Kubernetes**. ðŸš€

---

## **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
Before deploying your app, make sure you have:
1. **Docker** - To containerize your Node.js app.
2. **Kubernetes (Minikube or Cloud K8s)** - To run the cluster.
3. **kubectl** - The command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes.

### **Install Minikube (Local Kubernetes)**
If you donâ€™t have Kubernetes, install Minikube (for local testing):
```sh
# Install Minikube (for Linux/macOS)
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```
Start Minikube:
```sh
minikube start
```

---

## **Step 2: Create a Simple Node.js Application**
Create a directory for your app:
```sh
mkdir k8s-node-app && cd k8s-node-app
```
Create a simple **Node.js app** (`server.js`):
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from Kubernetes!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

---

## **Step 3: Create a Dockerfile**
To deploy this app on Kubernetes, we need a Docker container.

Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image
FROM node:18

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the files
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Create a `package.json` file:
```json
{
  "name": "k8s-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

---

## **Step 4: Build and Push the Docker Image**
Now, build and push the Docker image to **Docker Hub** or another container registry.

### **Login to Docker Hub**
```sh
docker login
```

### **Build the Image**
```sh
docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/k8s-node-app:v1 .
```
(Replace `<your-dockerhub-username>` with your actual Docker Hub username.)

### **Push the Image to Docker Hub**
```sh
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/k8s-node-app:v1
```

---

## **Step 5: Create Kubernetes Deployment and Service**
Now, we create Kubernetes configurations to **deploy** the app.

### **Create Deployment File (`deployment.yaml`)**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nodejs-app
spec:
  replicas: 2  # Number of Pods
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nodejs-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nodejs-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nodejs-app
          image: <your-dockerhub-username>/k8s-node-app:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
```
(Replace `<your-dockerhub-username>` with your actual Docker Hub username.)

### **Create Service File (`service.yaml`)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nodejs-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nodejs-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  type: NodePort
```
- This service **exposes the Node.js app on port 80** and routes it to pod port 3000.

---

## **Step 6: Deploy the App to Kubernetes**
Apply the deployment and service:
```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

Verify that pods are running:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```

Check if the service is running:
```sh
kubectl get services
```

---

## **Step 7: Access the Node.js App**
Since we are using **Minikube**, get the service URL:
```sh
minikube service nodejs-service --url
```
This will return a URL like:
```
http://192.168.49.2:xxxxx
```
Open this URL in a browser to see:
```
Hello from Kubernetes!
```

---

## **Step 8: (Optional) Use an Ingress for a Custom Domain**
Instead of accessing the app via NodePort, you can configure **Ingress** for a friendly URL.

### **Create an Ingress (`ingress.yaml`)**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nodejs-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myapp.local
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: nodejs-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Apply it:
```sh
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```
