# 🧠 30-Day LeetCode Interview Plan (Easy → Medium)

### Daily Structure (stick to this)

* **30 min**: Learn the pattern + notes
* **90 min**: Solve 2–3 problems
* **30 min**: Re-solve one problem without looking

If a problem takes >40 min, stop, read solution, move on. That’s normal.

---

## 🔹 WEEK 1 – Core Foundations (Days 1–7)

### **Day 1 – Arrays Basics**

* Two Sum
