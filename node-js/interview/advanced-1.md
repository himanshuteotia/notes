### üîÅ Event Loop & Asynchronous Internals

#### 1. **Explain the phases of the Node.js event loop.**
ÓàÉThe Node.js event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations. It operates in several phasesÓàÑÓàÜ

1. **Timers Phase**:ÓàÉExecutes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`ÓàÑ
2. **Pending Callbacks Phase**:ÓàÉExecutes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iterationÓàÑ
3. **Idle, Prepare Phase**:ÓàÉInternal use onlyÓàÑ
4. **Poll Phase**:ÓàÉRetrieves new I/O events; executes I/O related callbacksÓàÑ
5. **Check Phase**:ÓàÉExecutes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate()`ÓàÑ
6. **Close Callbacks Phase**:ÓàÉExecutes close event callbacks, e.g., `socket.on('close', ...)`ÓàÑÓàÜ
ÓàÉAdditionally, there are microtasks like `process.nextTick()` and Promises that are executed between these phasesÓàÑÓàÜ

#### 2. **What is the difference between `setImmediate()` and `process.nextTick()`?**

- **`process.nextTick()`**:ÓàÉExecutes the callback after the current operation completes, before the event loop continues. It's part of the microtask queueÓàÑÓàÜ

- **`setImmediate()`**:ÓàÉSchedules the callback to execute on the next iteration of the event loop, after the poll phaseÓàÑÓàÜ

**Example:**
ÓàÉ
```javascript
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
setImmediate(() => console.log('setImmediate'));
console.log('main');
```ÓàÑÓàÜ

**Output:**
ÓàÉ
```
main
nextTick
setImmediate
```ÓàÑÓàÜ
ÓàÉHere, `process.nextTick()` executes before `setImmediate()` because it's processed before the event loop continuesÓàÑÓàÜ

#### 3. **What happens if we use too many `process.nextTick()` calls?**
ÓàÉUsing too many `process.nextTick()` calls can lead to **I/O starvation**. Since `process.nextTick()` callbacks are executed before the event loop continues, a large number of them can prevent the event loop from reaching the I/O phases, delaying or blocking I/O operationsÓàÑÓàÜ

#### 4. **How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations internally (e.g., with libuv)?**
ÓàÉNode.js uses **libuv**, a C library, to handle asynchronous operations. When an asynchronous operation (like file I/O) is initiated, libuv delegates it to the system's kernel or a thread pool. Once the operation completes, libuv signals Node.js to execute the associated callback in the appropriate phase of the event loop. This architecture allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficientlyÓàÑÓàÜ

Great! Let‚Äôs continue with the next category:

---

### üî© **Streams & Buffers**

#### 5. **What are the different types of streams in Node.js?**

Node.js has four core types of streams:

1. **Readable** ‚Äì for reading data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`).
2. **Writable** ‚Äì for writing data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream`).
3. **Duplex** ‚Äì both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).
4. **Transform** ‚Äì a special type of Duplex stream that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read (e.g., `zlib.createGzip()`).

Streams are based on the EventEmitter API and emit events like:
- `data`: when data is available
- `end`: when no more data will be provided
- `error`: on error
- `finish`: when a writable stream ends

---

#### 6. **How do backpressure and `highWaterMark` work in streams?**

**Backpressure** occurs when a writable stream can't handle the amount of data being written to it as fast as it‚Äôs coming in. It‚Äôs a **signal to slow down**.

**`highWaterMark`** is the buffer limit. When the internal buffer size exceeds this threshold, it returns `false` on `.write()` and signals that the consumer is overwhelmed.

Example:
```javascript
const stream = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt', { highWaterMark: 16 });

let ok = stream.write('a very large chunk of data here...');
if (!ok) {
  console.log('Backpressure detected');
  stream.once('drain', () => {
    console.log('Resumed writing after drain');
  });
}
```

---

#### 7. **How would you implement a custom readable/writable stream?**

```javascript
const { Readable, Writable } = require('stream');

// Custom Readable
class MyReadable extends Readable {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
    this.index = 0;
  }

  _read() {
    if (this.index < 5) {
      this.push(`Chunk ${this.index++}\n`);
    } else {
      this.push(null); // No more data
    }
  }
}

// Custom Writable
class MyWritable extends Writable {
  _write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    console.log(`Writing: ${chunk.toString()}`);
    callback();
  }
}

const readable = new MyReadable();
const writable = new MyWritable();

readable.pipe(writable);
```

---

#### 8. **How does Node handle binary data? Explain Buffers.**

Node.js uses **`Buffer`** to handle binary data directly in memory, especially useful when working with TCP streams or file I/O.

Buffers are:
- Instances of the `Buffer` class
- Represent a fixed-size allocation of memory
- Can be converted to and from strings using encodings like `utf-8`, `base64`, `hex`

Example:
```javascript
const buf = Buffer.from('hello');
console.log(buf); // <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f>
console.log(buf.toString()); // 'hello'

const buf2 = Buffer.alloc(10); // Creates a zero-filled buffer
buf2.write('hi');
console.log(buf2.toString()); // 'hi'
```

Awesome! Here's the next section:

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Performance & Optimization**

#### 9. **How do you improve the performance of a Node.js app handling millions of requests?**

To handle massive loads, you should:

‚úÖ **Use Cluster or Worker Threads** ‚Äì Utilize all CPU cores.  
‚úÖ **Enable Caching** ‚Äì Use Redis/memory for frequently requested data.  
‚úÖ **Use a Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx)** ‚Äì For load balancing, compression, and static file serving.  
‚úÖ **Optimize DB Access** ‚Äì Use indexes, connection pooling, and batch queries.  
‚úÖ **Avoid Blocking Code** ‚Äì Long computations should go to worker threads.  
‚úÖ **Stream Data** ‚Äì Instead of loading large files into memory.

Bonus tools: `pm2` for process management, `nginx` for load balancing, `Redis` for caching.

---

#### 10. **How do you profile and debug a performance bottleneck in Node.js?**

Use tools like:

- **Chrome DevTools**: Use `node --inspect` and open in `chrome://inspect`.
- **Node.js built-in Profiler**:
  ```bash
  node --prof app.js
  ```
- **Clinic.js** (easy for production-like simulation):
  ```bash
  npx clinic doctor -- node app.js
  ```
- **`0x` Flamegraphs** for CPU usage visualization.

Analyze:
- High GC pauses
- Event loop delays
- Blocking calls (e.g., sync fs)
- High memory/CPU usage

---

#### 11. **What are memory leaks in Node.js, and how can you find and fix them?**

A **memory leak** is when memory is allocated but never released.

Common causes:
- Closures holding onto memory
- Event listeners not removed (`.on()` but no `.off()`)
- Caches growing indefinitely
- Global variables

To detect:
- Use `heapdump`, `--inspect`, `clinic heapprofiler`, or Chrome DevTools

Example using Chrome DevTools:
```bash
node --inspect app.js
```
Then go to `chrome://inspect` ‚Üí take heap snapshot ‚Üí analyze retained objects.

---

#### 12. **What tools do you use to monitor Node.js in production?**

- **Prometheus + Grafana** ‚Äì Custom metrics (`prom-client`)
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)** ‚Äì Logs, search, and visualization
- **PM2** ‚Äì Monitoring and process manager
- **Datadog / New Relic / Sentry** ‚Äì For performance, tracing, and error tracking
- **Node.js built-in metrics**:  
  Use `process.memoryUsage()`, `process.cpuUsage()`, and `process.hrtime()` to track stats manually.


### üì¶ **Module System & Code Architecture**

#### 13. **What is the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules in Node.js?**

| Feature                | CommonJS (`require`)                  | ES Modules (`import`)             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Syntax                 | `const fs = require('fs')`            | `import fs from 'fs'`             |
| Loading                | Synchronous                           | Asynchronous                      |
| File Extension         | `.js`                                 | `.mjs` or with `"type": "module"` |
| Scope                  | Modules are cached per file           | Modules are cached per file       |
| Compatibility          | Older & widely supported              | Newer standard, full in Node 14+  |
| `__dirname` / `__filename` | Available                         | Not directly available             |

Use **ESM** when writing modern apps that are future-proof or using top-level `await`. Use **CommonJS** for compatibility with older packages.

---

#### 14. **Explain dependency injection in Node.js with an example (e.g., TypeDI).**

Dependency Injection (DI) decouples the object creation and its dependency. In Node.js, this can be done manually or using libraries like **TypeDI**.

```javascript
import { Service, Container } from 'typedi';

@Service()
class UserService {
  getUser() {
    return { name: 'Himanshu' };
  }
}

@Service()
class UserController {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

  get() {
    return this.userService.getUser();
  }
}

const controller = Container.get(UserController);
console.log(controller.get()); // { name: 'Himanshu' }
```

This approach is testable, mockable, and clean.

---

#### 15. **How would you organize a large-scale Node.js application using Domain-Driven Design or Clean Architecture?**

üìÅ Project Structure Example (DDD-inspired):

```
src/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entities, value-objects, interfaces
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ use-cases (business logic)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ db, third-party services, external APIs
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers, routes
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/
```

üîπ **Benefits**:
- Decouples logic from frameworks (Express, DBs)
- High testability
- Business rules live in `domain` and `application`
- Infrastructure is replaceable

üî∏ Example: Don‚Äôt inject `MongoClient` into your domain. Instead, define an `IUserRepository` interface and implement it in `infrastructure`.


### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Best Practices**

#### 16. **How do you prevent SSRF, CSRF, and XSS attacks in a Node.js app?**

1. **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**:
   - Validate & whitelist internal URLs.
   - Avoid fetching user-provided URLs directly.
   - Block internal IPs (e.g., `169.254.x.x`, `127.0.0.1`, etc.).
   - Example:
     ```js
     const isSafeUrl = (url) => {
       const unsafe = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost'];
       return !unsafe.some((host) => url.includes(host));
     };
     ```

2. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**:
   - Use CSRF tokens for state-changing requests (`POST`, `PUT`, etc.).
   - Example: `csurf` middleware in Express.
   - Use `SameSite=Strict` or `Lax` on cookies.

3. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**:
   - Always sanitize user input (e.g., DOMPurify on frontend).
   - Use templating engines that auto-escape HTML (e.g., Handlebars).
   - Set headers via `helmet`:
     ```js
     const helmet = require('helmet');
     app.use(helmet());
     ```

---

#### 17. **What are some best practices for securing Express.js APIs?**

- ‚úÖ **Use Helmet**: Sets secure HTTP headers.
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting**: `express-rate-limit` to prevent brute force.
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Use `express-validator`, `Joi`, or `Zod`.
- ‚úÖ **Avoid exposing internal errors**: Don‚Äôt return stack traces to clients.
- ‚úÖ **CORS control**: Only allow specific origins.
- ‚úÖ **Use HTTPS**: Always secure communication.
- ‚úÖ **JWT handling**: Sign with strong secrets, set expiry, validate signature.
- ‚úÖ **Sanitize request data**: Prevent injection attacks.

Example:
```js
app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));
```

---

#### 18. **How do you protect against DOS attacks using middleware like `express-rate-limit`?**

Install and configure:
```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

```js
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 mins
  max: 100, // Limit each IP
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP. Try again later.',
});

app.use(limiter);
```

Other options:
- Use a **WAF** (Web Application Firewall)
- Detect anomalies using services like **Cloudflare**, **AWS WAF**, or **Fail2Ban**


### ‚ö° **Clustering, Worker Threads & Child Processes**

#### 19. **How does clustering work in Node.js? When should you use it?**

Node.js runs in a single thread, but you can utilize multiple CPU cores using the **`cluster`** module. It allows you to spawn multiple processes (workers) that share the same server port.

‚úÖ **Use when**:
- Your app is CPU-bound or needs to handle many concurrent connections.
- You want fault isolation ‚Äî if one worker crashes, others stay alive.

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const cpus = os.cpus().length;
  for (let i = 0; i < cpus; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died. Restarting...`);
    cluster.fork();
  });
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end(`Handled by PID ${process.pid}`);
  }).listen(3000);
}
```

---

#### 20. **When to prefer `worker_threads` over `child_process`?**

| Feature           | `worker_threads`                    | `child_process`               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Memory Space     | Shared memory                        | Separate memory               |
| Communication    | SharedArrayBuffer / MessagePort      | Inter-process (via IPC)       |
| Use Case         | CPU-bound tasks (e.g., hashing, AI)  | Spawn external scripts, heavy I/O  |
| Performance      | More lightweight                     | Heavier (OS-level process)    |

‚úÖ Use `worker_threads` for **CPU-bound JavaScript computation**.  
‚úÖ Use `child_process` for **external scripts** or CLI tools.

---

#### 21. **How do you share data between worker threads safely?**

Use:
- `MessageChannel` / `MessagePort`
- `SharedArrayBuffer` with `Atomics`
- Built-in `parentPort.postMessage()` API

Example:
```js
// worker.js
const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
parentPort.on('message', (data) => {
  parentPort.postMessage(data.toUpperCase());
});

// main.js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');
worker.on('message', (msg) => console.log('From Worker:', msg));
worker.postMessage('hello');
```

For shared memory:
```js
const shared = new SharedArrayBuffer(4);
const view = new Int32Array(shared);
Atomics.store(view, 0, 123);
```

### üìö **Advanced Concepts**

#### 22. **Explain how middleware chaining works in Express.js.**

Middleware functions in Express are functions that receive `req`, `res`, and `next`.

‚û°Ô∏è Middleware chaining works like a **pipeline**:
- Each middleware runs and either ends the request (`res.send()`, etc.)
- Or passes control to the next one using `next()`

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('First');
  next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Second');
  res.send('Done');
});
```

Output:
```
First
Second
```

If `next()` is not called, the chain is broken, and the request hangs.

---

#### 23. **What is the difference between `async/await` and Promises under the hood?**

| Feature           | Promises                           | async/await                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Syntax            | Chaining (`.then().catch()`)        | Synchronous-looking syntax       |
| Error handling    | `.catch()`                          | `try/catch`                      |
| Under the hood    | Uses microtask queue                | Compiles to Promise chains       |

`async/await` is **syntactic sugar** over Promises. It makes code easier to read but still works the same internally ‚Äî by returning Promises and resolving them via the event loop.

Example:
```js
async function getData() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return data;
}
```

Behind the scenes:
```js
function getData() {
  return fetchData().then(data => data);
}
```


#### 24. **How would you implement your own middleware pipeline (like Express)?**

```js
function createMiddlewarePipeline(middlewares) {
  return function (req, res) {
    let i = 0;

    function next() {
      if (i < middlewares.length) {
        const mw = middlewares[i++];
        mw(req, res, next);
      }
    }

    next();
  };
}

// Usage
const middlewares = [
  (req, res, next) => { console.log('1'); next(); },
  (req, res, next) => { console.log('2'); res.end('Done'); },
];

require('http').createServer(createMiddlewarePipeline(middlewares)).listen(3000);
```


#### 25. **How do you handle large file uploads efficiently in Node.js?**

‚úîÔ∏è Use **streams** to process data chunk-by-chunk instead of loading it all into memory.

Popular libraries:
- `multer` (multipart/form-data, memory or disk)
- `busboy` / `formidable` (stream-based)

Example:
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded');
});
```

Or custom stream approach:
```js
const busboy = require('busboy');

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const bb = busboy({ headers: req.headers });
  bb.on('file', (name, file, info) => {
    file.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(`./uploads/${info.filename}`));
  });
  req.pipe(bb);
});
```

Benefits:
- Low memory usage
- Stream to disk or cloud directly
- Handle gigabyte-sized uploads


### üß± **Microservices & Distributed Systems**

#### 26. **How do you design a microservice in Node.js using message queues like RabbitMQ/Kafka?**

‚úÖ **Key components of a microservice with message queue:**

- **Producer**: Sends messages to a topic/queue.
- **Broker**: RabbitMQ/Kafka transports messages.
- **Consumer**: Node.js service listens and processes.

**RabbitMQ Example:**
```js
// Producer
const amqp = require('amqplib');
const sendMsg = async () => {
  const conn = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
  const ch = await conn.createChannel();
  await ch.assertQueue('task_queue');
  ch.sendToQueue('task_queue', Buffer.from('Process Order'));
};

// Consumer
const receiveMsg = async () => {
  const conn = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
  const ch = await conn.createChannel();
  await ch.assertQueue('task_queue');
  ch.consume('task_queue', (msg) => {
    console.log('Received:', msg.content.toString());
    ch.ack(msg);
  });
};
```

**Kafka (via `kafkajs`)** is similar but suited for high throughput and log-based streaming.


#### 27. **What is event sourcing, and how can it be implemented in a Node.js backend?**

**Event Sourcing**:  
Instead of saving just the latest state, save a **sequence of events** that lead to the current state.

üåÄ Benefits:
- Full history
- Auditability
- Replayability

**Implementation:**
- Store events like: `UserCreated`, `OrderPlaced`, `OrderShipped`
- Rebuild state by replaying events

Example:
```js
// Event store
const events = [
  { type: 'AccountCreated', data: { balance: 0 } },
  { type: 'DepositMade', data: { amount: 100 } }
];

let state = { balance: 0 };
for (let event of events) {
  if (event.type === 'DepositMade') {
    state.balance += event.data.amount;
  }
}
```

In production: Use **event stores** like Kafka or EventStoreDB.

---

#### 28. **How do you maintain consistency in distributed systems using Node.js?**

üß† Approaches:

- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept delay in data syncing.
- **Sagas** (e.g., orchestrated workflows with compensation logic).
- **Idempotency**: Retry-safe operations.
- **Distributed locks**: Use Redis or Zookeeper to avoid race conditions.
- **Timeouts & retries**: Prevent hanging services.

Tools:
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Outbox pattern (to prevent double-processing)
- Circuit breakers (`opossum` in Node.js)
- Centralized logging/tracing (e.g., Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)

### üìà **Database and Caching**

#### 29. **How would you implement caching in Node.js using Redis?**

‚úÖ Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, product listings, API responses).

**Basic setup with `ioredis`:**
```js
const Redis = require('ioredis');
const redis = new Redis();

// Cache middleware
async function cacheMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const key = `user:${req.params.id}`;
  const cached = await redis.get(key);
  if (cached) return res.send(JSON.parse(cached));
  next();
}

// Route handler
app.get('/user/:id', cacheMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUserFromDb(req.params.id);
  await redis.set(`user:${req.params.id}`, JSON.stringify(user), 'EX', 60); // expires in 60s
  res.send(user);
});
```

üß† Patterns:
- **Cache aside** (manual): check cache ‚Üí fallback to DB ‚Üí set cache
- **Write-through**: write to DB and cache simultaneously
- **Invalidate**: delete cache on update

#### 30. **Explain connection pooling and its importance in Node.js with databases.**

üìå **Connection Pooling**: Reuses a set of pre-established DB connections instead of creating new ones for every request.

üîß Node.js DB drivers like `pg`, `mysql2`, or `mongoose` have pooling support:
```js
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ max: 10, idleTimeoutMillis: 30000 });

pool.query('SELECT * FROM users', (err, res) => {
  console.log(res.rows);
});
```

‚úÖ **Why important?**
- Reduces connection overhead
- Prevents exhausting DB max connection limit
- Improves performance under load

#### 31. **How would you structure sharded MongoDB with a Node.js backend?**

MongoDB sharding = horizontal partitioning. It splits large collections across shards (nodes).

**Steps**:

1. **Enable sharding**:
   ```bash
   sh.enableSharding('yourDb')
   ```

2. **Choose shard key wisely**:
   ```bash
   sh.shardCollection('yourDb.users', { userId: 1 })
   ```

3. **Node.js Driver** handles routing automatically via Mongo URI with multiple hosts:
   ```js
   const client = await MongoClient.connect('mongodb://shard1,shard2,shard3/db');
   ```

4. **Schema-level awareness**:
   - Use partition key (`userId`, `orgId`, etc.)
   - Design indexes based on shard key

‚úÖ Benefits:
- Improved scalability
- Distributed load
- Better analytics performance
