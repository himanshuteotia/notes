Both **child processes** and **worker threads** are used in Node.js to perform **CPU-intensive** or **parallel tasks**, but they have key differences in how they work and are used.

## ðŸ”¹ **Child Processes (`child_process` module)**
1. **Separate Memory Space**:
   - Each child process runs in its own memory space, separate from the parent process.
   - This means **no shared memory** between parent and child processes.

2. **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**:
   - Child processes communicate with the parent via **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** using **message-passing**.
   - Data is serialized (converted to a string) before being sent.

3. **Best For**:
   - Running **heavy CPU-bound tasks** without blocking the main thread.
   - Running **external commands** like shell scripts or system processes.

4. **Drawback**:
   - **Higher overhead** because each child process has its own memory and execution environment.

### âœ… Example: Using `child_process`
```javascript
const { fork } = require('child_process');

const child = fork('./worker.js');

child.send({ msg: 'Start Processing' });

child.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log('Received from child:', data);
});
```

## ðŸ”¹ **Worker Threads (`worker_threads` module)**
1. **Shared Memory**:
   - Unlike child processes, worker threads share the **same memory** as the main thread.
   - They can use **SharedArrayBuffer** to share data efficiently.

2. **Lower Overhead**:
   - Since workers run inside the same process, they have **less overhead** compared to child processes.

3. **Best For**:
   - CPU-intensive tasks that require **low-latency parallel execution** (e.g., image processing, large computations).
   - Tasks where **shared memory** is beneficial.

4. **Drawback**:
   - Requires more careful memory management since multiple threads operate on shared data.

### âœ… Example: Using `worker_threads`
```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
    const worker = new Worker(__filename);
    worker.postMessage('Hello Worker');
    
    worker.on('message', (msg) => {
        console.log('Received from worker:', msg);
    });
} else {
    parentPort.on('message', (msg) => {
        parentPort.postMessage(`Worker received: ${msg}`);
    });
}
```

## ðŸ”¥ **Key Differences:**
| Feature         | Child Process | Worker Thread |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Memory** | Separate memory | Shared memory |
| **Communication** | IPC (message passing) | Direct memory access |
| **Performance** | More overhead | Less overhead |
| **Use Case** | CPU-heavy tasks (isolated) | CPU-intensive tasks (shared memory) |
| **Example Tasks** | Running external scripts, heavy computations | Parallel computations, efficient processing |

### ðŸš€ **When to Use What?**
- **Use child processes** when you need **isolation**, such as running separate services or executing shell commands.
- **Use worker threads** when you need **shared memory** and lower overhead, especially for CPU-intensive tasks.
