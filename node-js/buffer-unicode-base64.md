Node.js: Buffers, Unicode, UTF-8, and Base64 ‚Äì Explained Simply

1. What is a Buffer?
	‚Ä¢	A Buffer is a temporary memory space used to store binary data in Node.js.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs used when handling:
	‚Ä¢	Files (e.g., PDFs, images)
	‚Ä¢	Network streams (HTTP, TCP)
	‚Ä¢	Low-level binary data

Why Buffer is Needed?
	‚Ä¢	JavaScript was built for browsers and deals mostly with text.
	‚Ä¢	Node.js needs to handle binary data, and strings aren‚Äôt suitable for that.
	‚Ä¢	So, Buffer was introduced in Node.js to deal with binary data safely and efficiently.

2. What is Unicode?
	‚Ä¢	Unicode is a universal system that gives a unique number (code point) to every character in every language.
	‚Ä¢	Example:
	‚Ä¢	'A' ‚Üí U+0041
	‚Ä¢	'‡§®' ‚Üí U+0928
	‚Ä¢	'üôÇ' ‚Üí U+1F642

Why Unicode?
	‚Ä¢	Solves compatibility issues between languages and systems.
	‚Ä¢	Supports all characters across different languages.

3. What is UTF-8?
	‚Ä¢	UTF-8 is an encoding system that converts Unicode characters into bytes (1 to 4 bytes per character).
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs the most popular and web-safe encoding format.

How UTF-8 Works:
	‚Ä¢	'A' ‚Üí U+0041 ‚Üí 0x41 (1 byte)
	‚Ä¢	'‡§®' ‚Üí U+0928 ‚Üí 0xE0 A4 A8 (3 bytes)
	‚Ä¢	'üôÇ' ‚Üí U+1F642 ‚Üí 0xF0 9F 99 82 (4 bytes)

UTF-8 Encoding & Decoding:
	‚Ä¢	Encode: Buffer.from('‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á', 'utf-8') ‚Üí converts to bytes
	‚Ä¢	Decode: buffer.toString('utf-8') ‚Üí converts bytes back to readable string

4. What is Base64?
	‚Ä¢	Base64 encodes binary data into plain text format using letters, numbers, +, /, and =.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs useful for storing or sending files as strings in HTML, JSON, or APIs.

Example:

const base64 = Buffer.from('Hello').toString('base64'); // "SGVsbG8="
const text = Buffer.from(base64, 'base64').toString('utf-8'); // "Hello"

5. Saving Files in Database
	‚Ä¢	For small files, use Buffer or Base64.
	‚Ä¢	For large files, save the file on disk/cloud (like AWS S3) and store the file path or URL in DB.

Buffer	Stores raw binary data in Node.js
Unicode	Gives unique number to every character
UTF-8	Converts Unicode to bytes and back
